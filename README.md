# Francesco Picazio

AI Engineer focused on designing risk-aware, decision-oriented systems operating in complex and safety-critical environments.

My work sits at the intersection of machine learning, system architecture, and product thinking. I do not treat models as isolated artifacts, but as components embedded within structured pipelines where data reliability, uncertainty estimation, and decision logic are engineered explicitly.

Over the past years, I have worked across industrial AI and automotive software, combining hands-on model development with architectural definition and technical coordination. This hybrid background allows me to reason both at modeling level and at system level — from data ingestion to deployment and operational impact.

## Engineering Approach

I build AI systems where:

- Data pipelines are designed before models
- Assumptions are made explicit
- Uncertainty is modeled, not ignored
- Decisions are risk-adjusted
- Trade-offs are documented and intentional

The objective is not prediction accuracy alone, but robustness, scalability, and real-world applicability.
